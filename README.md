# GitHub Team Sync
This utility is intended to enable synchronization between GitHub and various LDAP and SAML providers.
This is particularly useful for large organizations with many teams that either use GitHub Enterprise Cloud,
do not use LDAP for authentication, or use a SAML provider other than what is natively supported.
It supports both GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) and GitHub, but it will need to live in a location that can access your LDAP servers.

## Supported user directories
- LDAP
- Active Directory
- Azure AD
- Okta
- OneLogin

## Features
This utility provides the following functionality:

| Feature | Supported | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sync Users | Yes | Add or remove users from `Teams` in GitHub to keep in sync with Active Directory groups |
| Dynamic Config | Yes | Utilize a `settings` file to derive Active Directory and GitHub settings |
| LDAP SSL | No | SSL or TLS connections. This is a WIP |
| Failure notifications | Yes | Presently supports opening a GitHub issue when sync failed. The repo is configurable. |
| Sync on new team | Yes | Synchronize users when a new team is created |
| Sync on team edit | No | This event is not processed currently |
| Custom team/group maps | Yes | The team `slug` and group name will be matched automatically, unless you define a custom mapping with `syncmap.yml` |
| Force custom map | Yes | Sync only team defined in `syncmap.yml` |
| Dry run / Test mode | Yes | Run and print the differences, but make no changes |
| Nested teams/groups | No | Synchronize groups within groups. Presently, if a group is a member of another group, it is skipped |

## Creating the GitHub App on your GitHub instance
1. On your GitHub instance, visit the `settings` page on the organization that you want to own the **GitHub** App, and navigate to the `GitHub Apps` section.
    - You can access this page by visiting the following url:
      `https://<MY_GITHUB_HOSTNAME>/organizations/<MY_ORG_NAME>/settings/apps`
2. Create a new **GitHub App** with the following settings:
    - **Webhook URL**: URL of the machine on which this app has been deployed (Example: `http://ip.of.machine:3000`)
    - **Homepage URL**: URL of the machine on which this app has been deployed (Example: `http://ip.of.machine:3000`)
    - **Webhook Secret**: The webhook secret that will be or has been defined as an environment variable in your deployment environment as `WEBHOOK_SECRET`
    - **Permissions and Events**: This application will need to be able to manage teams on GitHub, so the `events` and `permissions` listed below will be required. For more information on how to create a GitHub App, please visit [https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app)
3. Once these have been configured, select the `Create GitHub App` button at the bottom of the page to continue
4. Make a note of the `APP ID` on your newly-created **GitHub App**. You will need to set this as an environment variable when configuring the app.
5. Generate and download a private key from the new App page, and store it in your deployment environment. You can either do this by saving the file directly in the environment and specifying its path with the environment variable `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`
6. After you have created the **GitHub** App, you will need to install it to the desired **GitHub** Organizations.
    - Select `Install App`
    - Select `All Repositories` or the desired repositories you wish to watch
