# GitHub LDAP Team Sync
This utility is intended to enable synchronization between LDAP/Active Directory and GitHub when using SAML for authentication. This is particularly useful for large organizations with many teams, including nested teams. It supports GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise

## Features
This utility provides the following functionality:

| Feature | Supported | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| List | Yes | List users in Active Directory groups or GitHub Teams |
| Add Users | Yes | Add users to `Teams` in GitHub when they are present in the AD group and not in the GitHub `Team` |
| Remove Users | Yes | Remove users from `Teams` in GitHub when they are not present in the Active Directory group |
| Sync Users | Yes | Add or remove users from `Teams` in GitHub to keep in sync with Active Directory groups |
| Dynamic Config | Yes | Utilize a `settings` file to derive Active Directory and GitHub settings |
| Email Notifications | No | Email administrators when the script fails and, optionally, succeeds. This is a WIP |
| LDAP SSL | No | SSL or TLS connections. This is a WIP |
| Slack Messaging | No | Send a notification to Slack. This is a WIP |

## Getting Started
To get started, ensure that you are using **Python 2.7** or **Python 3.4+**. The following additional libraries are required:

- [ ] PyGithub
